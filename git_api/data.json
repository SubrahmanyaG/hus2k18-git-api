So having something in the UI to manage the databases would be very helpful.

    "body": "Hi again,\r\n\r\nAfter going trough the code a few times to make docker images and deploy inside our infrastructure I realized that this project might be being deployed with default security configurations that Django asks you to change before running in production. I'll bring them up for discussion on how to address them. The ones I have found are:\r\n\r\n1) `DEBUG=True` Related source: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.11/ref/settings/#debug\r\n\r\n2) `SECRET_KEY` to hard coded value. Related: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.11/ref/settings/#secret-key\r\n\r\n3) `ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['*']` Related: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.11/ref/settings/#allowed-hosts\r\n\r\nI don't really understand Heroku one click deployments but I see some of the challenges to make the changes. I think using environmental variables and asking the users to change them when deploying is the way to go.\r\n\r\nIn our custom deployment I have been able to patch most of them, maintaining a parallel version of the code, except for the `DEBUG` one. When set to `False` the site starts to fail with this error `ValueError: The file 'css/bootstrap.min.css' could not be found with <whitenoise.storage.CompressedManifestStaticFilesStorage object at 0x7f49fb148bd0>.`\r\n\r\nHope this is useful. Let me know if something is not clear or there's something else I can do. Thanks!"

    "body": "Hi,\r\n\r\nI've been tracking an issue we have been experiencing for a few hours. Basically creating a simple query with a String parameter fails to run with the error: `TypeError __init__() got an unexpected keyword argument 'format'`. Debugging the error shows that in file `squealy.views:155` an instance of `squealy.parameters.String` is being created using the `kwargs` json dict saved on the DB. Checking the DB shows that indeed a `format` key is being set in such dict.\r\n\r\nDebugging the calls made by the browser showed that the front-end sends such parameter in all cases with the last value registered. However, it seems such value should only be send when the parameter is a `Date` or a `DateTime`. Hence, when the parameter is a `String` the `format` kwarg breaks the `__init__` of the class and the exception is thrown.\r\n\r\nI think sending the `format` parameter only when needed in the front-end should solve it. I haven't worked on any React app so no attempt at a PR for now. A server side validation could be nice to avoid these kinds of errors. I'll check if I can come up with something decent to solve the issue.\r\n\r\nAnyway, thanks! Hope this is useful. Let me know if you need further input to reproduce and fix this one."

I am currently going through the effort of \"dockerizing\" the code and it was hard for me to figure out what versions of python the project was build for and tested on. Through the process I realized that python 3 is not an option given the dependency `MySQL-python` which is not compatible (maybe it is worth looking into changing for `mysqlclient` which is a fork of the former one and python 3 compatible). Anyway, I think it is worth mentioning in the README.md that only python 2 is supported and other restrictions that you guys think are relevant. Thanks again and hope the input is valuable."

Right now I'm going through the process of \"dockerizing\" this project for our project, so it can integrate seamlessly with our infrastructure. While getting used to the project I encountered a bug, only reproducible when using more that one database in the `QUERY_DB` environment variable. The exception was due to a missing key in line 25 of this file. I think the intention here was to delete the default query db; however, putting this instruction inside the `for` loop attempts to delete it several times (if more that one DB is specified) and the application does not start. This small change seems worth sharing, so feel free to merge if appropriate. The other small changes are just suggested styling issues. Thanks again for the project, hope my input is valuable."
